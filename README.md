**TO DO**

>The free subscription with the fixer API did not allow us to use the Time-Series Endpoint. 
This is needed to draw the graph. 
Currently, the graph is drawn from dummy data taken from fluctuating the latest exchange rate of the result value. 

> I have used two text file assets to load the country names, country code, and their relevant currency code due to the limited time availability. This can be done by one text file.

**Important**
The project has used Git LFS. Therefore, to download the project, it must be cloned. Downloading manually will not download the project well.
